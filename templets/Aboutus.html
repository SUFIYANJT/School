            The Kerala School for the Blind, established in 1955, is a pioneering institution dedicated to the education and empowerment of visually challenged children. Located in Vallikkappatta, Malappuram district, Kerala, we are the first government-aided special school of our kind in the state. Founded by the late Mr. Chandrasekharan, a retired military officer, the school has since been managed by a dedicated team committed to continuing his legacy of excellence in education for the blind.
            Our institution serves over 70 children, ranging from pre-primary to 7th standard, with a focus on not only providing high-quality education but also fostering holistic development. We take pride in our specialized section for deaf-blind children, the only one of its kind in Kerala, offering tailored support to meet their unique needs.
            At the Kerala School for the Blind, our goal extends beyond academic achievement; we aim to nurture every childâ€™s potential, encouraging them to pursue their aspirations and build a successful future.
